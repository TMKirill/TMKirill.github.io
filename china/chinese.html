<span class="abstract-title"><b>Abstract:</b></span>  In Early China,
‘daybook’ (<em>rishu</em> 日書) divination manuals were consulted to
determine auspicious times for a variety of life events. Recent
discoveries of daybook manuscripts written upon bound bamboo strips have
revealed much about how these manuals were compiled in the first
centuries BC. Multiple different divination systems appear on the same
manuscript, resulting in a confusion of running text, lists, and
diagrams. In order to navigate these manuscripts efficiently, daybook
compilers utilized certain strategies to aid their users. Taking the Han
period Zhoujiazhai 周家寨 daybook as a case study, this article surveys
the strategies employed in this manuscript to differentiate textual
units. Attention is given to the materiality of the writing support,
judicious framing with empty space, features of the calligraphy,
punctuation usage, indexing, and the presence of both explicit titles
and embedded identifiers.</div>

<p>In China, during the Warring States period (453–221 BC) and
continuing into the Han empire (206 BC–AD 220), people were often buried
with items they used in daily life for continued use in the underworld.
This at times happened to include manuscripts, written on strips of
bamboo or wood, bound together with cords. With the development of
archaeology as a discipline in China this past century, alongside
fast-paced urbanization and unfortunate resurgence in looting in recent
decades, many of these buried manuscripts are now being unearthed. These
finds include not only some of the earliest versions of celebrated
works, such as the <em>Daodejing</em> 道德經 (<em>Classic of the way and
virtue</em>, or alternatively the <em>Laozi</em> 老子), but also
previously unknown philosophical treatises, poetry, historical anecdotes
and annals, law codes, administrative documents, medical recipes,
scribal primers, and much more.<input id="sn-0" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-0" class="footnote-number"></label><small><span class="citation" data-cites="tsien2013a">Tsien

recent discoveries.</small></p>
<p>The <span class="click-highlight GenshanDiagram"><em>Root
mountain</em> diagram</span> on strips #2–12, reminiscent of an inverted
mountain, dwarfs the Rong calendar diagram on strip #9. It utilizes the
sexagenary cycle of day-counts employing paired heavenly stems and
earthly branches. Beginning with the stem-branch pairing for the first
day of a given month, the user alternately assigns a heavenly stem or
earthly branch to the spaces marked <em>ri</em> 日 or ‘day’, continuing
the sexagenary cycle. This proceeds from the top-right corner of the
diagram, across each horizontal row, down to the bottom of the diagram,
then returning back to the top corner, repeating as necessary to finish
the count. Doing so produces a set of paired stems and branches that are
‘split’ by the central vertical column, which bears spaces containing an
image akin to the character <em>shan</em> 山, the word for ‘mountain’.
These are considered to be the ‘split-up days’, for which the appended
text describes how certain activities are either auspicious or
inauspicious. <input id="sn-1" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-1" class="footnote-number"></label><small>Kalinowski <span class="citation"
data-cites="kalinowski2017a"> (<a href="#ref-kalinowski2017a"
role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>: 185-187)</span> focuses specifically on
the version in the first Shuihudi daybook (strips #47–60
<em>recto</em>). The Zhoujiazhai and Kongjiapo versions have an
additional horizontal row of eight spaces, for 38 total, compared to the
Shuihudi exemplar, which has 30 spaces total. Kalinowski argues that the
Shuihudi version is better suited for this counting practice, but warns
that the added horizontal row in the Zhoujiazhai and Kongjiapo versions
cannot be dismissed as merely a copyist’s mistake (p. 186). On a perhaps
related note, consider the additional <em>ri</em> 日 fitted into the
leftmost spot in the third row from the top.</small></p>
<p>The last diagram, <span class="click-highlight YuTang"><em>Yu and
Tang’s divination for childbirth,</em></span> consists of two human
figures, drawn on strips #13–17 and #23–27 respectively.<input id="sn-2" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-2" class="footnote-number"></label><small>Another version, found in the first Shuihudi daybook
(strips #150–4 recto), is explicitly titled <em>Renzi</em> 人字 (strip
#150 recto), or <em>Childbearing</em>, which is thematically analogous
to the Zhoujiazhai embedded title of <em>Yu and Tang’s divination for
childbirth</em>. The Kongjiapo daybook also included this diagram
(strips #379–88), but only traces of it now remain, as the section of
the manuscript on which it was drawn is damaged. Other versions of the
diagram are found on a number of other excavated daybooks and medical
treatises (e.g. at Zhoujiatai, Mawangdui 馬王堆, and in the Chinese
University of Hong Kong collection), with a particularly beautiful
example drawn in bright red on the Peking University Han daybook: see
Beijing daxue <span class="citation" data-cites="daxue2011a"> (<a
href="#ref-daxue2011a" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>: pl. image
#3)</span>.</small> They are hard to miss, as the ample use of black ink
catches the eye. These figures can be used as a key for divining a
child’s fortunes based on the date of their birth. The first
consideration is the season in which the child was born. The figure to
the right is labelled ‘spring, summer’, while the figure to the left is
labelled ‘autumn, winter’. Once the correct figure has been determined,
the next consideration would be the earthly branch of the day on which
the child was born. The twelve earthly branches are written in
succession around the figures, placed beside different parts of the body
(head, shoulders, armpits, etc.). The <span
class="click-highlight YuTangTextBlock">instructional text</span> found
between the two figures (strips #18–21) explains what each body bart
portends for the child.</p>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>A variety of strategies adopted in the Zhoujiazhai daybook help
readers navigate between and within multiple textual units. These
include the exploitation of the material divisions in the writing
support itself, such as using binding cords to demarcate upper and lower
registers, or isolating each earthly branch divination on an individual
bamboo strip. Empty space frames textual units. Explicit titles are
present, as are embedded identifiers. The calligraphy hints at textual
divisions, whether through the elongation of a character’s final stroke
or by writing in drastically different sizes. In one instance, it
appears that a punctuation mark, a dot, offsets a separate diagram. The
diagrams themselves can capture a reader’s attention and direct them to
a given textual unit. These are the strategies apparent in the
Zhoujiazhai daybook strips published thus far.</p>
<p>While these are among the most common strategies employed to signal
different textual units in early Chinese daybooks, they do not form an
exhaustive list, and a few other options were sometimes used. For
instance, other early Chinese daybook manuscripts use a bright red
colour to write text, punctuation, and diagrams, in contrast with the
typical black ink. The Peking University Han period <em>Liubo</em> 六博
offers a pertinent example, as it includes Rong calendar diagrams much
like the one found on Zhoujiazhai strip #9 that are written in bright
red.<input id="sn-3" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-3" class="footnote-number"></label><small>See Beijing daxue <span class="citation"
data-cites="daxue2014a"> (<a href="#ref-daxue2014a"
role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>: 186, 196, 210)</span>, strips #25 and 26,
following the manuscript’s current arrangement, though the inclusion of
these strips in the manuscript is open to debate.</small> Another, albeit rarer, strategy was to invert some
writing. For example, a calendar among the Zhoujiatai #30 Qin cache
inverts one text as a way of affiliating its content with the date
heading a different register from the one on which it was written <span
class="citation" data-cites="hubeisheng2001a"> (Hubei sheng <a
href="#ref-hubeisheng2001a" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>: strip #49,
pp. 15, 95, 97, n. 11)</span>. Inverted text can also be seen among the
Qin period <em>Liye</em> 里耶 and Han period <em>Juyan</em> 居延 (xin
新) caches, though on administrative documents.<input id="sn-4" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-4" class="footnote-number"></label><small>An introduction to these examples, and discussion of
their relationship to the inverted text in the received version of the
<em>Shiji</em> 史記, may be found in Wang Zhiyong <span class="citation"

<p>Reflecting upon the manuscript culture of Early China, and
particularly that of the Western Han period (206 BC–AD 9) when the
Zhoujiazhai daybook was produced, the strategies outlined above can be
considered to be <em>standard</em> but not <em>regular</em>. That is to
say, certain conventions were widely recognized as being the best way to
signal divisions in textual units, from the use of explicit titles,
punctuation, or empty spaces, to the exploitation of material features
of the writing supports, such as binding cords and the bamboo strips
themselves. Yet whether or not a given strategy was adopted at any
particular time was largely a matter of localized decision-making by the
scribe(s) who produced a manuscript for a specific audience. In fact,
for each of the strategies listed above, the Zhoujiazhai daybook
presents moments both where they were adopted faithfully, and where they
were ignored. The central binding cord divides strips #1–12 into upper
and lower registers separating <em>Marrying off a daughter</em> (Text
#1) from <em>Root mountain (diagram) for Yu’s split-up days</em> (Text
#2), yet *<em>Childbirth</em> (Text #4) straddles the central binding
cord on strips #13–25, preferring to isolate each earthly branch
divination on individual bamboo strips instead. <em>Marrying off a
daughter</em> could have elongated the final strokes of the concluding
characters in its divination statements, as seen in
*<em>Childbirth</em>, yet the scribe opted not to do so. These are just
a few examples.</p>
<p>In the above survey of strategies employed to signal discrete textual
units in the Zhoujiazhai daybook, the methods adopted largely rely on
visual information.<input id="sn-5" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-5" class="footnote-number"></label><small>See the excellent discussion on manuscript formatting
in <span class="citation" data-cites="krijgsman2018a">Krijgsman (<a
href="#ref-krijgsman2018a" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</small> This may be due to the fact that a multitude of competing
divination systems were included in daybooks such as this one, whose
initial compilation (and theoretically later re-compilations) could be
rather fluid. These daybooks also functioned in practice as reference
works, to be digested sporadically and in piecemeal fashion, potentially
by a single reader in isolation. Information needed to be pulled out of
a confusion of data easily and quickly. Yet manuals like the Zhoujiazhai
daybook participated in a special genre of texts—as a type of technical
literature—and were therefore not necessarily representative of early
Chinese textuality at large.<input id="sn-6" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-6" class="footnote-number"></label><small><span class="citation"
data-cites="krijgsman2018a">Krijgsman (<a href="#ref-krijgsman2018a"
role="doc-biblioref">2018: 15–16</a>)</span> argues that producers of
technical manuscripts, including daybooks, who were impacted keenly by
their own experiences in the pragmatic use of such manuals, spurred on
the development of visual formatting that eventually spread to other
genres.</small> Other methods for signalling textual units may be found,
for instance in scribal primers such as the <em>Cang Jie pian</em>
蒼頡篇, where lists of vocabulary terms are grouped into longer chapters
via shared rhyming relationships, producing an aurally unmistakable unit
of text when a manuscript is read aloud.<input id="sn-7" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-7" class="footnote-number"></label><small>For rhyming in daybooks, see <span class="citation"
data-cites="krijgsman2021a">Krijgsman (<a href="#ref-krijgsman2021a"
role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>.</small> As such, attempts to uncover who actually consulted these
early Chinese manuscripts, and how such texts were used ‘on the ground’,
require attention not only to their content, but also to the logic
behind their presentation.<input id="sn-8" type="checkbox" name="footnotebox"><label for="sn-8" class="footnote-number"></label><small>To this end, it is likewise crucial to consider
archaeological contexts, which are absolutely vital to the
reconstruction of audiences and their relationships to the manuscripts
in question.</small></p>
